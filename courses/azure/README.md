## Summary

Azure is one of the biggest Cloud Providers and it's owned by Microsoft

### Main Services

#### [Resource Groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal)

They are grouping of different resources

#### App Service

- Used to host apps on Azure and we delegate scaling and managing it to Azure
- Apps are hosted on an App Service plan which define how the app vm is behaving
- App Service plans determines how much resources you will get
- App Service plans can be: Shared, Dedicated, Isolated, Consumption (for functions)
- App Service plan can be though of a certain flavour of a VM
- Azure Funtions can run in the same App Service plan
- Authentication & Authorization can be handled by Azure using Identity Providers or even by the app itself
- Azure service plans are divided into two modes of networking:
  - Multi-Tenant: Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, and PremiumV3 SKU pricings
  - Single-Tenant: Isolated SKU pricing
- More on [Networking](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/networking-features)
- Environment secrets are configured in "Configurations"
- Settings for app is configured under "General Settings"
- You can define custom handlers for files with certain extension and mount volumes under "Path Mapping"
- Multiple logging levels is supported: Application, Web Server, Detailed error, Failed request trace, Deployment.
- Linux only supports Application and Deployment logging, windows supports the reset.
- Logs can be saved on File system (temporay), Blob storage (Long-Term) or can be streamed
- Available security certificates: Free Managed certificate, Puchased from Azure, Imported from a Key Vault, Upload private certificate, Upload public certificate (to access external resources)
- You can redirect all HTTP to HTTPS under "TLS/SSL Settings"
- Feature Flags can be managed also with App Configurations
- Each flag should have a name and a filter that when evaluated will set it to `True` and we can set the return value directly too.
- Auto scaling support scale in-out (horizontal scaling)
- Auto scaling condition can be based on a metric (ex: no of HTTP requests) or scheduled for a specific time
- Metrics can ne: CPU %, Memeory %, Disk queue length (I/O Requests), Http Queue Length, Data In, Data Out. It's possible to scale based on other Azure services too.
- Auto scalaing condition is done over a period of time "Duration" and can be aggregated by: Average, Minimum, Mammum, Total, Last and Count.
- Not all pricing tiers have auto-scaling
- Auto-scalaing has minimum, default, maximum values
- Auto-scalaing prevents "flapping" where after a scale out it scales in and then scales out again. Read the example [here to understand how to avoid it](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/scale-apps-app-service/5-autoscale-best-practices)
- Make scale out higher than scale in with a correct margin to avoid flapping
- With multiple Auto-scaling rules, any rule will scale-out but all rules must be met to scale-in

**Commands**

- `az webapp up -g $resourceGroup -n $appName --html`: Create and update App Service

#### Azure Functions

- They are the stateless solution from Azure
- Execution is done on:
  - Triggers: When to execute the code
  - Binding: Coding for input and Output
- Azure Logic Apps: Similar to functions but more GUI friendly and has many integrations (similar to Zapper)
- Azure WebJobs
  // @todo: need to read more about it again

- [Azure Functions Core tools](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools): Used for local development
- [Testing functions locally with http-triggers and non-http triggers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=v4%2Cmacos%2Ccsharp%2Cportal%2Cbash)

#### Azure Cosmos DB

- Multi-master replication support which reduces latency to almost real-time
- 99.999% read and write availability all around the world.
- Add and remove regions at anytime without the need to pause/redeploy the application
- Multiple data consistency mode: Strong, Bounded Staleness, Session, Consistent Prefix, Excentual
- There are multiple APIs available: Core (SQL), MonogoDB, Cassandra, Table, Gremlin
- Item index = Partition Key + Item ID
- Cosmos DB Account > Container > Table > Items

#### Service Bus

- Supports the following

  - No polling is required, FIFO, automatic de-duplication
  - Pub/sub using topics
  - Process messages as streams using session ID // @todo new to find what that is?
  - 64kb < Message size < 256 KB

- It consists of the folloing entities
  - Queues (supports FIFO)
    - FIFO
    - Two modes to recieve messages
      - Recieve and Delete: one-stage, mark as consumed when read, system is ok tolerating missed messages
      - Peek Lock: Two-stages, mark as consumed after done, there is a timeout for failure
  - Topics and Subscriptions
    - Go for 1-to-many
    - Publisher (Message) -> Topic -> Subscription -> Consumer
    - Subscription is in this case like a virtual queue
    - Subscriptions supports filters to select a certain sub-set of messages

Access Policy (Auth Keys) can be per queue or a shared access policy across all queues

**Commands**

- Create a service bus namespace

```sh
az servicebus namespace create \
    --resource-group az204-svcbus-rg \
    --name $myNameSpaceName \
    --location $myLocation
```

- Create a service bus queue

```sh
az servicebus queue create --resource-group az204-svcbus-rg \
    --namespace-name $myNameSpaceName \
    --name az204-queue
```

#### Storage Queue

- Similar to Service bus and supports the following

  - Queue size over 80 GB
  - Track progress in the queue // @todo: what it means?
  - Good for logging
  - It's a subset of the Blob storage
  - It consists of a queue and an Azure Storage
  - It's simplier than Service Bus

- When to use Storage Queues and Service Bus?

If you just need queues then Storage queues or Service Bus (Basic) should be enough as we only pay per operation or per storage. While Serivce Bus (Standard+Premium) will cover more complicated cases with Deduplication, topics and sessions.

### General Commands

- Create a resource group
  `az group create --name az204-svcbus-rg --location $myLocation`

- Delete a resource group
  `az group delete --name az204-svcbus-rg --no-wait`
