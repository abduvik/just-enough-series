### How is the .NET world structured

A .NET is a collection of language and libraries. Then we have our target which can be web (ASP.NET) or Mobile or Desktop or IoT and so on. C# is the main language.

We have .NET framework which is the old .NET and can only work on Windows.

Today we have the new .NET Core which is cross-platform and can work anywhere (aka. like JAVA).

There is a package manager callend NuGet

### Tools

- We can use Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code or JetBrains Rider
- We need to install the .NET Sdk
- There is also a CLI tool `dotnet` which supports multiple templates

### Language Summary

- The config files for a project is under `*.csproj`. It's similar to `package.json`
- namespaces are a way to organize our code similar to folders and make sure that if two classes with same under different namespaces are still unique (especially when sharing code through pacakges)

- Generic Example

```csharp
using System;

namespace CSharpTestingConsole
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var bank = new BankAccount();
            Person person = new(); // will do object creation implicitly

            Console.WriteLine("Hello World");

            string wage = Console.ReadLine();

            // int wageValue = int.Parse(wage);

            int wageValue;
            if (int.TryParse(wage, out wageValue))
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Success");
            }
        }
    }

    public class BankAccount {
        public string GetTransactions() {
            // Object-Initializer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_J_CLKwoto
            // It's a way to avoid creating multiple constructors
            var person = new Person
            {
                Name = "Abdu",
                City = "Berlin"
            };


        GetSum(y: 10, x: 20);

        return person.Name;
    }

    public int GetSum(int x, int y)
    {
        return x + y;
    }

    /**
     * `ref` pass by reference and need to be initialized
     * `out` will pass by reference but doesn't need to be initialized. It's used in case you need to return n+1 things
     */
    public int GetSumAndRef(int x, out int y)
    {
        y = 10;
        return x + y;
    }

    /**
    Async/Await operation is handled by Tasks
    **/
    // public static Task async callVisa(){
    //     Task<VisaOperation> = await VisaService.CallVisa();
    //     // Task.WhenAll === Promise.all
    //     // Task.WhenAny === Promise.any
    // }
    }

    public class Person {
        public string Name;
        public string City;
        public string FirstName { get; set; }
        public string LastName { get; set; }

        public string FullName => $"{FirstName} {LastName}";

        public Person() {

        }

        public string GetFullName()
        {
            // return String.Format("{0} {1}", FirstName, LastName);
            // return String.Concat(FirstName, LastName);
            return FirstName + LastName;
        }
    }
};


```

### Modifiers

- `abstract`: Can't use `new`, need to be inherited and implemented. In case of preprties, methods, indexers, events -> you must implement them
- `override`: Required to extend or modify the abstract or virtual implementation of an inherited method, property, indexer, or event.
- `static`: method,proptery is shared across all objects on the class-level and we call them through the class, so no need to use the `new` keyword

### Types in .NET

Value Types:

- `enum`: Collection of values as a string
- `struct`: Similar to classes by lightweight and is value type instead of a pointer like classes

Reference Types:

- `class`
- `interface`
- `delegate`

### null and nullable

Reference types can hold the value null when they reference to nothing

Value Types needs to hold a value but we can define them as "Nullable Value Types" which means that they can hold a value or null. They are defined by appending a `?` ex: `int? x`.

### Keywords

- `using` statement forces the code to run `Dispose` method instead of writing `try...finally`
- `new` It can be used as a modifier to override inherited properties and methods in a class by creating a new one

### Important Classes

- JSON

  - `JsonSerializer`: To Serialize/Deserialize JSON to Object
  - `JsonSerializerOptions`: To pass options for the `JsonSerializer`. Use `JsonSerializerDefaults.web` to get default options used for the web.
  - `JsonNode`: It's very similar to what `JSON` does in Javascript and is very simple and we can use `JsonNode.Parse` to do the exact same thing as `JSON.parse` in JS.
  - `JsonObject/JsonArray`: It's used to create Json objects and arrays quickly instead of having a class for it.
  - `JsonDocument`: Faster than the `JsonNode` and is good if we have a large JSON. It works similar to how DOM access works in HTML.
  - `Utf8JsonWriter/Utf8JsonReader`: High performace JSON writer and reader and it's low level and works as streams

- HTTP

  - `HttpClient`: To do HTTP requests
  - `HttpClientJsonExtensions`: Extentions to the `HttpClient` to send/recieve HTTP content as JSON
  - `HttpContentJsonExtensions`: Extentions to the `HttpClient` to read and parse the HttpContent based on JSON

- Files & Directories

  - `System.IO.Directory`: Class with static methods to deal with directories
  - `System.IO.File`: Class with static methods to deal with files

- Others

  - `StringBuilder`: Used when we are doing too many operations on strings to save memory. THat's because strings are immutable and are referenced-type instead of value

### LINQ

`n` is an integer, `r` is a range `5..9`, `3..`, `..9`, `^9..^5`, `l` is a list, `λ` is a lamda function, `pc` is a comparer function

Possible LINQ operations

- Select: `select/Select(λ)` to get a single property, use it with `new` if we need multiple properties
- Ordering (ascending, descending): `orderby/OrderBy(λ)` & `orderby descending/OrderByDescending(λ)`. We can order by multiple fields by just adding a `,` between them
- Projection (change shape)
- Get an Element (find, first last, single): `First(λ)`, `FirstOrDefault(λ)`, `Last(λ)`, `LastOrDefault(λ)`, `Single(λ)`, `SingleOrDefault(λ)`
- Filter (`where`)
- Iteration/Partioning (foreach, skip, take)
  - `Take(n)`, `Take(r)`, `TakeWhile(λ)`: To get couple of items
  - `Skip(n)`, `Skip(r)`, `SkipWhile(λ)`: To skip few items
  - `Skip` + `Take` can be used to do pagination, they are like `LIMIT` in SQL
  - `Distinct()`, `DistinctBy(λ)`: To get unique values
  - `Chunk(n)`: Divide an enumerable into chucks of arrays
- Quantify (any, all, contains)
  - `Any(λ)`: If any item validate the condition
  - `All(λ)`: If All item validate the condition
  - `Contains(v)`: If enumerable contains a primative value
  - `Contains(new Obj { prop = val}, comparer)`: To find if contains an object, comparer inherits from `EqualityComparer` and overrides methods `Equals` & `GetHashCode`
- Set Comparison (equal, except, intersection)
  - `SequenceEqual(l)`, `SequenceEqual(l,pc)`: If they are equal
  - `Except(l)`, `Except(l,pc)`, `ExceptBy(l, λ)`: To find what doesn't exists in list
  - `Intersect(l)`, `Intersect(l,pc)`, `IntersectBy(l, λ)`: To find what is common between two lists
- Set Operations (union, concat)
  - `Union(l)`, `Union(l,pc)`, `UnionBy(l, λ)`: To combine two lists and remove the duplicates
  - `Concat(l)`: To concat two lists and keep the duplicates
- Joining (inner joins, outer joins)
  - `join .. in .. on .. equals ..`: To Inner Join two lists
  - `Join(l, λ(1), λ(2), λ(new))`: To Inner Join two lists
  - `join .. in .. on .. equals .. into ..`: To Inner Join two lists and group each of them to a new list which can further has more Linq operations
  - `GroupJoin(l, λ(1), λ(2), λ(new)`: It will do the same thing as `into` keyword
  - Left Outer Join is simulated. it's mainly done by doing an inner join and return a default null if it doesn't exists and then creating new objects from that list.
    // @todo: read more about left outer join
- Aggregation (count, sum, min, max, average)
  - Methods are `Count(λ)`, `Min(λ)`, `Max(λ)`, `Sum(λ)`, `Average(λ)` returns numbers
  - Methods `MinBy(λ)`, `MaxBy(λ)` will return objects
  - Method `Aggregate(λ)` will perform a reduce
- Grouping (groupby, subquery, groupjoin)
- Distinct Sets (distinct)

Linq supports two formats

- Lamda (Method) Syntax
- Query (Comprehension) Syntax

Linq operations can be divided into Immediate and Deferred. Deferred can also be divided into Streaming and Non-Streaming

- Immediate: the operation is executed immiedately
- Deferred: The operation execution is deferred for later
  - Non-Streaming: Operation is done completely
  - Streaming: Operation runs on every request and `yield` a new value each time it's needed

### Nullable Reference

This is an opt-in feature. It's enabled by adding `#nullable enable` at the top of the file or by adding it to the project file `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>`

- `?`: To make a type nullable otherwise it's non-nullable
- `!`: To tell the compiler that we are sure that the value is not null
- `??`: To assign a default value if the value is null
- `??=`: To assign a default value if the value is null and return the value
- `?? throw`: To throw an exception if the value is null
- `?? new`: To create a new object if the value is null
- `?? default`: To assign a default value if the value is null

### Async Programming

### Questions

- What is the difference between `interface` and `abstract` class?

We inherit from one class but can implement multiple interfaces. Abstract class are used as base classes and can have partial implementation but interfaces are more as contract

- What is the difference between `new` and `override`+`virtual`?

`new` will create a new method that only exists for this type. So if we used casting it will use the parent method rather than the child method

`override`+`virtual` is to actually override the member methods in correct polymorphism

- How C# complier knows where is Main method?

Newer versions can find main implicitly. You can set the flag `EnableDefaultCompileItems` to false in the project configs and then you will need to explicitly include the entry point

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

    <PropertyGroup>
        <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
        <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
        <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
        <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
        <EnableDefaultCompileItems>false</EnableDefaultCompileItems>
    </PropertyGroup>

    <ItemGroup>
        <Compile Include="Program.cs" />
    </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

- What is the difference between struct and classes?

struct are value-typed, so when you assign the value of a variable to another variable we create a new complete copy of it while classes is a pointer to an object on the heap and when we assign an object to another variable it gets the pointer instead of the whole object.

## Important Commands

- `dotnet new`: To create a new Project
- `dotnet publish`: To publish the app

When publishing too, we can either publish as:

- Framework Dependent: Expect the .NET framework is installed
- Self-contained: dotnet will ship .NET with the project
