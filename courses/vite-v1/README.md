## Summary

Why vite?

- It uses ESBuild to bundle our dependencies
- It uses native ESM to serve our source code and do HMR

This makes Vite much faster than other tools

Though for bundling to production, it uses Rollup as ESbuild is still limited regarding important features like code
splitting.

Vite only performs transpilation on `.ts` files and does NOT perform type checking
