# Just Enough Series

Repository to host files for "Just Enough" YouTube Series by @abduvik.

Everyday there is a new technology and it's hard to follow them. And what makes matters worse is that after we learn them we forget them.

That's why the goal for this series is to make jumping into new technologies much faster and you can always come back if you need to remember something you forgot.

I will be sharing here my personal self-learning notes and also the notes of the awesome contributors to make this a thriving source to quickly remember what you have forgot.
